# Company-Bankruptcy-Prediction

The goal of this project is to select and find the key features that helped to predict bankruptcy. Secondly, visualize interesting patterns present in the data. Since the target output is binary, we put forward the idea of binary classification models to classify a company as bankrupt or not. We aim to find the suitable features that affect bankruptcy using different feature learning techniques; test and compare multiple machine learning models for our proposed task. This will help the organizations to make wise business decisions, invest wisely and reap profits.
